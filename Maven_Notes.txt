Maven Clean => deletes target folder
Maven Compile => compiles all .java files in to .class files in the Target folder
Maven Test-Compile => compiles the project files and test files
Maven Test in intelliJ is skipping running test by deafault | To force running the tests run mvn test -Dmaven.test.skip=false
		report of the test is saved in the target/surefire-reports
Maven install => creates a jar file for the project in the root of Target folder and installs it to the local repository
Maven Package => creates a jar without installing it to the local repository

Maven build life cycle :
Validate -> Compile -> Test -> Package -> Integration Tests -> Verify -> Install -> Deploy

Every time a maven goal is executed all of the goals before it in the build life cycle are executed as well
